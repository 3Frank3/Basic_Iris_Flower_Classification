# Basic_Iris_Flower_Classification

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Iris Flower Classification problem using various machine learning algorithms. The project demonstrates how to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features.

## The main algorithms used in this project include:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes, which can be extended to multiclass classification using techniques like one-vs-rest.
- **Decision Tree**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification technique that                

finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. 
- **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.
- **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.
- **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, designed for distributed and efficient training.     
- **CatBoost**: A gradient boosting library that handles categorical features automatically, making it easier to work with datasets that include such features.
- **AdaBoost**: An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier, focusing on misclassified instances.
- **Extra Trees**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions, similar to Random Forest but with more randomness in the tree construction.
- **Neural Networks**: A set of algorithms modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and classify data.
